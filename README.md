A simple snake game that I created myself as part of improving my programming skills.

The game should work properly on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Importing and running: http://libgdx.com/dev/import-and-running/

I used:
- library libGDX 1.10 https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/
- Gradle 6.7

Created and implemented features:

- creating a board, generating and "animating" a snake and the food in random points
- simple sound effects
- the snake "animation" pace depends on elapsed time not FPS
- locked direction reverse
- game is over if the snake eats itself

Planned additional features:

- various snake elements
- game restart
- pausing the game
- result list or score counter
