A simple snake game that I created myself as part of improving my programming skills.

The game should work properly on following OS: Windows, macOS, Linux.

Importing and running: http://libgdx.com/dev/import-and-running/

I used:
- library libGDX 1.10
  https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/
- Gradle 6.7

Created and implemented features:
- creating a board, generating and "animating" a snake and the food in random points
- the snake moves at a pace that depends on elapsed time not FPS
- direction reversal lock
- game over if the snake eats itself

Planned additional features:
- various snake elements
- restarting the game
- pausing the game
- result list
