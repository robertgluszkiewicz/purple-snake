The Snake game that I created myself as part of improving my programming skills. The libraries and concept used are not part of the Java Developer training.

1. Importing and running: http://libgdx.com/dev/import-and-running/


2. Game control:
   - press UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT key to move the Snake
   - press N to start new game


3. To create and built project I used:
   - library libGDX 1.10.0 https://javadoc.io/doc/com.badlogicgames.gdx/gdx/1.10.0/
   - Gradle 6.7


4. Implemented features:
   - creating the board, "animating" a snake and the food in random points
   - simple sound effects
   - the snake "animation" pace depends on elapsed time not FPS
   - locked direction reverse
   - game is over if the snake eats itself
   - game restart
   - score counter


5. Planned additional features:
   - various snake elements
   - pausing the game

6. Game screen:
