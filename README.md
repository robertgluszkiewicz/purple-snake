A simple snake game that I created myself as part of improving my programming skills. The libraries and concept used are not part of the Java Develeper course.

The game should work properly on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Importing and running: http://libgdx.com/dev/import-and-running/

I used:
- library libGDX 1.10 https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/
- Gradle 6.7

Created and implemented features:

- creating the board, "animating" a snake and the food in random points
- simple sound effects
- the snake "animation" pace depends on elapsed time not FPS
- locked direction reverse
- game is over if the snake eats itself

Planned additional features:

- various snake elements
- game restart
- pausing the game
- result list or score counter
